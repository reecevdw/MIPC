% The intellectual core of your case.

% Framework idea: “The Biodiversity Investment Loop”
% 	1.	Screen: Identify biodiversity-linked risks/opportunities (e.g., TNFD, ENCORE).
% 	2.	Select: Invest in assets with measurable ecological value (using biodiversity KPIs).
% 	3.	Transform: Reinvest forestry revenues into high-impact restoration.
% 	4.	Report: Use a “Biodiversity-Adjusted Return (BAR)” framework to link financial and natural outcomes.

% You could visualize this as a 4-step loop or flow chart — visual clarity is huge in MIPC reports.

% Add your measurement proposal (e.g.):
% 	•	Biodiversity Impact Unit (BIU): € invested per hectare restored or per species recovered.
% 	•	Portfolio Biodiversity Intensity (PBI): weighted biodiversity exposure per asset class.
