\section*{Diagnostic: Legacy Portfolio \& Gaps}

\subsection*{Where We Are}
Borealis Wealth Fund (BWF) manages \textbf{€10B} and has delivered an average \textbf{6.5\%} annual return since launch. The legacy portfolio is diversified across public markets, fixed income, and real assets, but ESG screening has not explicitly targeted biodiversity outcomes.

\subsection*{What Works}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Solid core beta:} Low-cost public equity exposure and green infrastructure provide diversified return drivers and partial inflation protection.
    \item \textbf{Policy alignment (climate):} Green infrastructure and thematic credit align with climate transition risks and EU taxonomy to a degree.
    \item \textbf{Liquidity balance:} A meaningful liquid sleeve (equities, credit, cash) supports rebalancing and new program launches.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Binding Constraints }
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{2035 Net-Zero Pathway:} Finland’s forests shifted from a carbon sink to a carbon source in 2021, compressing the national carbon budget and intensifying scrutiny on land-use and forestry practices.
    \item \textbf{EU Nature Regulation:} The EU Biodiversity Strategy and Nature Restoration Law increase compliance pressure, making traditional high-yield forestry less viable without demonstrable ecological outcomes.
    \item \textbf{Trade and Competitiveness:} International buyers, especially within the EU, increasingly demand traceable, biodiversity-positive supply chains. Failure to meet these standards risks market access and export competitiveness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Identified Gaps}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{ESG $\neq$ Biodiversity:} Current ESG screens do not capture habitat integrity, species abundance, deadwood density, or landscape connectivity. 
    \item \textbf{Logging Yields vs. Future EU Regulations:} EU biodiversity laws and restoration targets will likely constrain harvest volumes. The Fund’s return model must anticipate this by investing in higher-value wood products and wood-based innovation, enabling profitability even with lower yields.
    \item \textbf{Liquidity vs. Long-term Natural Assets:} Real assets such as forestland and green infrastructure generate durable impact but remain illiquid. Without sufficient liquidity, the Fund risks being unable to pivot or scale new biodiversity projects. A structured cash and green bond allocation can serve as \emph{impact working capital} to fund near-term transitions.
    \item \textbf{Domestic Exposure vs. Global Trade Partners:} While increasing Finland’s forestry investment supports domestic biodiversity goals, overconcentration exposes the Fund to local regulatory, ecological, and market shocks. International ESG equities and green infrastructure holdings mitigate this by sustaining diversified trade and financial linkages.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Implications for Strategy }
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item Implement a strategy that focuses on net-zero goals while also addressing biodiversity through maintaining forested lands investments and reforesting new land.
    \item Establish a \emph{Value-over-Volume} logging model, reinvesting profits into R\&D and venture capital that increase wood product margins.
    \item Maintain 15\%–20\% of the portfolio in liquid green bonds and cash to ensure flexibility in meeting restoration and reforestation funding needs.
    \item Strengthen cross-border ESG equity exposure to sustain Finland’s trade relationships and hedge domestic forestry concentration risk.
    
\end{itemize}
